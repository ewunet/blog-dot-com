                final rating: 3.5/10 stars. i thought it was cool i liked the beat :/
                i think sound-wise this album isnâ€™t bad at allâ€¦I actually quite like 
                the production on these songs (hot uptown, b.o.a.t., pretty when i cry). 
                I like the styles of music on this album and how they were executed was 
                quite good. like on a pure musical level i enjoyed this a lot. camila 
                having rosaliaâ€™s long time producer on here is really interesting to me, 
                as is the hyperpop influences in the instrumentation/vocal work/lyricism.
                She clearly has this, like, eye on â€˜alternativeâ€™ pop sound and he 
                (el guincho) does well with adding that flair to the albumâ€™s production 
                himself. i kind of thought that quirkyness wud b more heavy handed, 
                after hearing he would be on CXOXO and hearing the I LUV IT/I Got It 
                clone snippet before the albumâ€™s release, but iâ€™m glad the whole album 
                isnt quite like that. 
                I think if anything my biggest issue is Camila herself and how juvenile 
                this album is as a wholeâ€¦if I was like twelve and loved
                hip hop/hyperpop/reggaeton/mainstream pop all at the same time this 
                would be the album Iâ€™d fantasize about in my room. the hip hop/pop songs 
                she chooses to sample r stupidly obvious choices, lyrically the songs r 
                childish, especially the more sexually suggestive they get (DREAM-GIRLS 
                and HE KNOWS) and for the life of me i cant tell if that was like, an 
                intentional vibe that camila was trying to go for or whether this was 
                truly her exerting herself as an artist and just falling that bad. The 
                features on this album are all great but itâ€™s literally just Camilaâ€™s 
                kind of out of place self dragging those songs back. CXOXO is filled 
                with this mimicry of singing styles and lyrical content that u can 
                tell Camila finds cool, that at best unintentionally propel the music 
                itself (pretty when i cry) but at worst come off as nursery rhyme-ish 
                (Chanel No. 5)--babyâ€™s first AAVE, even (June Gloom). this album is a 
                fun experiment for camila but maybe just for her
                Individual Song Review! 
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>I LUV IT (w/Playboi Carti): apple commercial doooown</li>
                <li>Chanel No. 5: Flop very bad</li>
                <li>pink xoxo: pink diamond, xcx, cxoxo like do yall 
                    see the correlation. this song is the most hyperpop-leaning too like huh</li>
                <li>HE KNOWS (feat. Lil Nas X): theater kid duo at the talent show concept</li>
                <li>Twentysomethings: feels like sheâ€™s describing love/a relationship between 
                    two highschoolers but itâ€™s about love in ur twenties (?) too immature to me 
                    but if SZA sang it maybe iâ€™d b more convinced. Im not quite sure yet</li>
                <li>ðŸ˜½ Dade County Dreaming (feat. JT & Caresha): i quite like this song SORRY 
                    but i love the sparseness of the beat w/ the City Girls on top of it. 
                    I will say I get irritated when Camila starts singing</li>
                <li>koshi xoxo (feat. BLP Kosher): idk if i can be negative about this but 
                    likeâ€¦how was camilaâ€™s music the music u cried toâ€¦?</li>
                <li>HOT UPTOWN (feat. Drake): aaaaaah idk i liked this song ðŸ¤­</li>
                <li>Uuugly: itâ€™s just Drake on this song for some reason essentially but 
                    i like this one too</li>
                <li>DREAM-GIRLS: i get that this song is supposed to b like pop-reggaeton 
                    fusion but feels like a little sisterâ€™s idea of a reggaeton/club songâ€¦YKW 
                    this reminds like kids bop thatâ€™s what this is</li>
                <li>305tillidie: interlude, she feels lost</li>
                <li>B.O.A.T.: i like the cuteness of the pitbull sample</li>
                <li>âœ…pretty when i cry: thereâ€™s another house inspired song on this album 
                    somewhere i forgot which one, Production is great and i like the 
                    repitition/kind of nonsensical lyrical style with this type of music. 
                    Best song to me</li>   
                <li>June Gloom: unserious as is most of this album</li>     
            </ul>
